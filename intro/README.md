# Some notes

- `float` in Python is the same as the `double` type in C language as it is represented as double precision using IEEE 754

## Answers to some exercises

- **Exercise 1.12:** We saw that `bool("False")` is `True` because `"False"` has numerical equivalent, if we add all the ASCII values of each letter. You can try this with any strings, even with `bool("0")` because character `"0"` is `48` in ASCII[^1].
